# Bank of Flatiron

## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup

1. In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this [data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EWN0qLfAWfgzO1N2P8H5WmrsTx0nMkhp3s-rXVESTNA/edit) for your server DB.
2. Run this command to get the backend started: `json-server --watch db.json`
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app in a new port.

## Endpoints

The base URL for the backend is: `http://localhost:3000`

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
